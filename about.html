                     In a recent job interview I was asked to describe myself in five words. I said “scientist, visionary, writer, Taurus, and musician” in that order. I’m Christopher Borges, I’m a Film/Philosophy/English triple major taking a few gap years while I find myself and explore the supernatural.

                     When I’m not filming, I’m reading, writing, lifting, or playing with my The Dresden Dolls cover band called “The Maybe Virginias.” I love cats, coffee, the Legend of Zelda, and open mindedness.

                      I don't know man, I'm just here for the paycheck. They told me they'd pay me if I filmed them trying to summon some spirits or something, so I agreed. It turned into me doing all the work while they act like idiots on camera, which i guess is fine by me since I at least dont have to show my face.

                    I also made the website, someone please hire me.
